# 🏗️ System Design 101

Welcome to **System Design 101** — a beginner-friendly series where we break down complex system design concepts into simple, practical explanations.  

Whether you’re a student, preparing for interviews, or just curious about how large-scale systems work, this series is for you. We’ll mix **theory, diagrams, and code samples** so you not only understand the “what” but also the “why” behind design decisions.
